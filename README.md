# Policy Schema for Apigee X/hybrid policies

A set of XML Schemas (XSD 1.1) that describe the required and optional parts of
the XML "Domain specific language" for Apigee X/hybrid policies.

## Background

Currently, Google has published a set of Schemas for Apigee at [this
link](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/schemas).  But
these schema are outdated. They do not
support recent extensions in the configuration possibilities for existing
policies , nor do they include more recently added policies.

This set of schemas attempts to provide current schema for current policies.

However,

- these schemas are not directly, officially supported by Google.
- The support is "best effort" by me and other Apigeeks
- You can file issues on Github if you find problems. Or file PRs on them.
- There is no set of schema for Apigee Edge

## Disclaimer

This example is not an official Google product, nor is it part of an
official Google product.

## Using the Schemas

To use the schemas, you will need an XSD validator tool.

These schemas are implemented using XSD 1.1. They rely on
[xs:assert](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/#cAssertions) (and xs:assertion)
which were added to XSD in XSD v1.1. Therefore, you will need an XSD-1.1
compliant validator to use them.  I've included some example validators in this
repo. You can also build your own in any language/platform that supports XSD 1.1

> .NET does not natively support XML Schema Definition (XSD) 1.1. While
> Microsoft's built-in XML tools support XSD 1.0, they don't include features
> like assertions (xs:assert) and other features in XSD 1.1. To work with XSD
> 1.1 in .NET, you'll need to use a third-party library like Saxon HE.


## Example Validation Scripts

This repository includes some examples for validating policy files, or bundles.

- [./py](python) - using the xmlschema module
- [./java](java) - using XercesJ 2.12.2
