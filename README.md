# Policy Schema for Apigee X/hybrid policies

A set of XML Schemas (XSD 1.1) that describe the required and optional parts of
the XML "Domain specific language" for Apigee X/hybrid policies.

## Background

Currently, Google has published a set of Schemas for Apigee at [this
link](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/schemas).  But
these schema are outdated. They do not
support recent extensions in the configuration possibilities for existing
policies , nor do they include more recently added policies.

This set of schemas attempts to provide current schema for current policies.

However,

- these schemas are not directly, officially supported by Google.
- The support is "best effort" by me and other Apigeeks
- You can file issues on Github if you find problems. Or file PRs on them.
- There is no set of schema for Apigee Edge

## Disclaimer

This example is not an official Google product, nor is it part of an
official Google product.

## Using the Schemas

To use the schemas, you will need an XSD validator tool.

These schemas are implemented using XSD 1.1. They rely on
[xs:assert](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/#cAssertions) (and xs:assertion)
which were added to XSD in XSD v1.1. Therefore, you will need an XSD-1.1
compliant validator to use them.  You can build a simple validator tool in
Python using the xmlschema module, or in Java using its builtin JAXP. I've
included an example python-based validator in this repo.

> .NET does not natively support XML Schema Definition (XSD) 1.1. While
> Microsoft's built-in XML tools support XSD 1.0, they don't include features
> like assertions (xs:assert) and other features in XSD 1.1. To work with XSD
> 1.1 in .NET, you'll need to use a third-party library like Saxon.


## Example Validation Script

This repository includes a Python script, `validate.py`, to validate a single XML
file against one of the provided XSD schemas.

### Pre-requisites

- Python 3.13
- xmlchema module (see the requirements.txt file)

### Setup

To use the script, you'll need to install its dependencies. It's recommended to
use a Python virtual environment.

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the script like this:

```bash
./validate.py --xsd schema/TheSchema.xsd --xml /path/to/your/policy.xml
```

For example, to validate a sample `AssignMessage` policy:

```bash
./validate.py --xsd schema/AssignMessage.xsd --xml /path/to/your/assign-message-policy.xml
```

## Practical Validation

Probably, you will want a validator that does more than validate a single policy
file against a single, specified Schema. Instead you will probably want
something that examines pall of the policy files in a bundle, and then validates
each one against the appropriate schema file provided here.

A tool that does that, is, for the moment, left as an exercise for the reader.
